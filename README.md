# Comp-Tools
An attempt to create some tools for composition, and store them in one place.
I would like to try and create some tools that could make the process of composition more interesting for myself,
and maybe also for others. These tools are not intended to reduce the agency of the composer, or to take away their
role in the composition process. Rather, they are designed to automate some of the smaller menial tasks that one 
might encounter when composing a piece with elements that can be described mathmatically. 

I might try and expand it to include some algorithms used by some other famous composers like Xenakis later on, but
for now, it is just a small passion project of mine. Hope you enjoy!
